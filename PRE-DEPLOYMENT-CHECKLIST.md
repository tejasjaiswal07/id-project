- [ ] All vulnerabilities resolved: `npm audit fix`
- [ ] node_modules not committed to git

### Code Review
- [ ] All recent changes reviewed for security
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- [ ] No test/debug code left in production build
- [ ] Error messages don't expose sensitive information

## Functionality Testing

### Local Testing

- [ ] Application builds with `npm run build` without errors
- [ ] Application runs with `npm start` without errors

### Feature Testing
- [ ] Instagram downloader works with valid URLs
- [ ] Instagram downloader rejects invalid URLs with proper error
- [ ] Download progress is tracked and displayed
- [ ] Download history is saved (if enabled)
- [ ] Email subscription works (if enabled)
- [ ] Share buttons work (if enabled)

### API Endpoints
- [ ] `/api/health` returns proper health status
- [ ] `/api/health/performance` returns performance metrics
- [ ] `/api/download/optimized` accepts POST requests
- [ ] `/api/info/enhanced` returns media information
- [ ] Rate limiting is working properly
- [ ] Proper error messages returned for invalid inputs

### Performance
- [ ] Performance dashboard (`/performance`) loads and displays data
- [ ] Download speed is acceptable (1-3 seconds for Instagram)
- [ ] Memory usage is reasonable during downloads
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended testing

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Private Instagram posts are rejected with proper error
- [ ] Invalid URLs are rejected with proper error
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully
- [ ] Large files don't cause timeouts
- [ ] Concurrent downloads work correctly

## Deployment Preparation

- [ ] Architecture decisions documented
- [ ] Known issues documented
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide created ✓

## Deployment Execution

### Pre-Deployment Steps
- [ ] Latest code committed to git
- [ ] All environment variables verified as correct
- [ ] Database migrations run (if applicable)
- [ ] Backup created before deployment

### Deployment
- [ ] Code deployed to production
- [ ] Environment variables set in production
- [ ] Health check endpoint working
- [ ] All APIs responding correctly
- [ ] No 5xx errors in logs

### Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Performance metrics reasonable
- [ ] No errors in error tracking (Sentry)
- [ ] Rate limiting working
- [ ] Cron jobs scheduled and running
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Log aggregation working

## Ongoing Maintenance

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Monitor error rates and logs
- [ ] Monitor performance metrics
- [ ] Check user reports (if any)
- [ ] Be ready to rollback if critical issues

### First Week
- [ ] Review all error logs
- [ ] Analyze performance trends
- [ ] Check for security issues
- [ ] Verify backup/restore procedures work

### Regular Maintenance (Weekly)
- [ ] Review performance metrics

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues occur after deployment:

1. **Identify the issue**
   - Check logs for errors
   - Review metrics for anomalies
   - Gather user reports

2. **Prepare rollback**
   - Get previous deployment version
   - Prepare rollback commands
   - Notify team members

3. **Execute rollback**
   - Revert to previous deployment
   - Verify system is working
   - Document what went wrong

4. **Investigation**
   - Analyze what caused the issue
   - Fix the problem
   - Test thoroughly before re-deployment
